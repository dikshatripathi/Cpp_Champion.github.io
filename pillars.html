                <h5><b> Encapsulation- </b></h5>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulation refers to bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single
                        unit.
                    <li>Many
                        programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.</li>
                    <li> A class is an example of
                        encapsulation in computer science in that it consists of data and methods that have been bundled
                        into a
                        single unit.</li>

                    <li>Encapsulation may also refer to a mechanism of restricting the direct access to some components
                        of an
                        object, such that users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular
                        object.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated
                        with an
                        instantiated class or object.</li>
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/enc.png" alt="image" style="width: 420px; height:250px; display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>In other words: Encapsulation is about wrapping data and methods into a single class and
                        protecting it
                        from outside intervention.</li>

                    <li>The general idea of this mechanism is simple. For example, you have an attribute that is not
                        visible
                        from the outside of an object.</li>
                    <li> You bundle it with methods that provide read or wote access.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation allows you to hide specific information and control access to the objects internal
                        state.</li>

                <h5><b> Abstraction- </b></h5>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li> Abstraction means providing only some of the information to the user by hiding its internal
                        implementation details. We just need to know about the methods of the objects that we need to
                        call
                        and the input parameters needed to trigger a specific operation, excluding the details of
                        implementation and type of action performed to get the result.</li><br>

                    <li> Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the

                        object to the user.</li> <br>
                    <li>It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. It is one of

                        the most important concepts of OOPs.</li><br>
                    <li> Real-life example: When you send an email to someone, you just click send, and you get the
                        success
                        message; what happens when you click send, how data is transmitted over the network to the
                        recipient
                        is hidden from you (because it is irrelevant to you).</li> <br>

                    width: 50%;">



                    <li> We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. </li><br>
                    <li>The class helps us to group data members and
                        member functions using available access specifiers.</li><br>
                    <li> A Class can decide which data members will be
                        visible to the outside world and not.</li><br>
                    <li>Access specifiers are the main pillar of implementing
                        abstraction in C++.</li><br>
                    <li> We can use access specifiers to enforce restrictions on class members.</li><br>

                <hr>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> inheritance is one of the key features of Object-oriented programming in C++, it allows us to
                        create a
                        new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class)</li><br>

                    <li> The derived class inherits the features from the base class and can have additional

                        features of its own Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which
                        makes it
                        easier to

                        create and maintain an application.</li><br>

                width: 50%;">
                    <br>

                    <li> This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code

                        functionality and fast implementation time.</li><br>

                    <li> When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the
                        programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class.
                        This
                        existing class is called the base class, and the new class is referred to as the derived class.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Technically, inheritance is defined as the process of acquiring the features and behaviors of a
                        class by another class. Here, the class that contains these members is called the base class,
                        and
                        the class that inherits these members from the base class is called the derived class of that
                        base

                <hr>

                C supports five types of inheritance they are as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Single Inheritance :</b>

                        In single inheritance, one class can extend the functionality of another class. There is only
                        one parent
                        class and one child class in single inheritances.</li><br>

                        width: 50%;">
                    <br><br>

                    <li><b> Multilevel Inheritance:</b>

                        When a class inherits from a derived class, and the derived class becomes the base class of the
                        new
                        class, it is called multilevel inheritance. In multilevel inheritance, there is more than one
                        level.</li><br>

                    <br><br>
                    <li><b> Multiple Inheritance:</b>

                        Multiple Inheritance In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit more than one class. This
                        means that a single child class can have multiple parent classes in this type of inheritance.
                    </li><br>

                    <li><b>Hierarchical Inheritance</b>

                        Hierarchical inheritance in hierarchical inheritance, one class is a base class for more than
                        one derived class.

                    <br>

                    <li><b> Hybrid Inheritance</b>

                        Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. For example. A child
                        and
                        parent class relationship that follows mul and hierarchical inter stances can be called hybrid

                    <li>Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming,
                        Polymorphism is
                        a concept that allows you to perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is the
                        combination
                        of two Greek words. The poly means many, and morphs means forms. So polymorphism means many
                        forms. Let's
                        understand polymorphism with a real-life example.</li>

                    <li> Real-life example: A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at
                        the same
                        time is a father, a husband, and an employee.</li><br>
                    <li> So the same person possesses different behavior in
                        different situations. This is called polymorphism,</li><br>

                    There are two types of polymorphism in C++

                <h5><b>Compile time Polymorphism</b></h5>
                <hr>

                Compile-time polymorphism is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphum can be achieved
                through function overloading or operator overloding.<br><br>

                <ol type="a">
                    <li><b> Function overloading: </b><br> When there are multiple functions in a class with the same
                        name but different

                        parameters, these functions are overloaded. The main advantage of function overloading is that
                        it
                        increases the program's readability. Functions can be overloaded by using different numbers of
                        arguments
                        or by using different types of arguments. We have already discussed function overloading in
                        detail in
                        the previous module</li><br>

                    <li><b> Operator Overloading:</b><br>

                        C++ also provides options to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator for the
                        string
                        class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to
                        add two
                        operands. When placed between integer operands, a single operator, adds them and concatenates
                        them when
                        placed

                        between string operands<br><br>

                        <b>Points to remember while overloading an operator:</b><br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> it can be used only for user-defined operatorstobjects, structures but cannot be aded
                                for in-built
                                operators(int, char, float, etc).</li>

                            <li> Operators and & are already overloaded in Ce to avoid overloading them.</li>

                            <li>The precedence and associativity of operators remain intact.</li>

                Runtime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism Method overriding is a y to
                implement runtime polymorphism<br>

                <br>
                <b> Method overriding </b><br>

                Method overriding is a feature that allows you to redefine the parent class method in the child
                class based on its requirement. In other words, whatever methods the parent class has by default are
                available in the child class. But, sometimes, a child class may not be satisfied with parent class
                method
                implementation. The child class is allowed to redefine that method based on its requirement.
                This
                process is called method overriding<br><br>

                <b> Rules for method overriding</b>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The parent class method and the method of the child class must have the same name</li><br>
                    <li>The parent
                        class
                        method and the method of the child class must have the same

                        parameters </li> <br>
                    <li> It is possible through inheritance only.</li><br>

                <p>
                    A virtual function is a member function in the base class that we except to redefine in derived
                    classes. It is declared using the virtual keyword.<br>
                    A virtual function is used in the base class to ensure that the function is overridden. This
                    especially applies to cases where a pointer of base class points to a derived class object.<br>
                    C++ determine which function is invoked at the runtime based on the type of object pointed by the
                    base class pointer when the function is made virtual.<br>

                <p>
                    A pure virtual function is a virtual function in C++ for which we need not write any function
                    definition and have to declare it. It is declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.<br>
                    A pure virtual function in C++ is a virtual function we implement , But we must override that
                    function in the derived class otherwise, the derived class will also become an abstract
                    class.<br><br>
