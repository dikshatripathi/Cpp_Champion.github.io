                    Object-Oriented Programming is basically a programming style that we used to follow in modern
                    programming. It primarily revolves around classes and objects. Object-Oriented programming or OOPS
                    refers to the language that uses the concept of class and object in programming. The popular
                    object-oriented programming languages are c++, java, python, PHP, c#, etc. The main objective of
                    OOPs is to implement real-world entities such as polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation,
                    abstraction, etc.
                    <br>
                    The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no
                    other part of the code can access this data except that function.
                    <br>
                    <b>Syntax:</b>
                    class class_name{
                    <br>
                    //class body<br>
                    //properities<br>
                    //methods<br>
                    }
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <div>
                    <b> Class </b>

                    A class is a logical entity used to define a new data type. A class is a user-defined type that
                    describes what a particular kind of object will look like. Thus, a class is a template or blueprint
                    for an object. A class contains variables, methods, and constructors.
                    <br><br>
                    Classes are very useful in programming. Consider the example of where you don't want to use just one
                    car but 100 cars. Rather than describing each one in detail from scratch, you can use the same car
                    class to create 100 objects of the type 'car. You still have to give each one a name and other
                    properties, but the basic structure of what a car looks like is the same,
                    <br>
                    The car class would allow the programmer to store similar information unique to each

                    car (different models, maybe different colors, etc.) and associate the appropriate

                    information with each car.
                    <br><br>
                    Here,
                    <br><br>
                    <b>class:</b> class keyword is used to create a class in C++,<br>

                    <b>class Name:</b> The name of the class. <br>

                    <b>class body:</b> Curly braces surround the class body.<br>


                    <br><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b>Object</b>


                    An object is an instance of a Class. It is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and
                    behavior. Objects are the basic units of object-oriented programming. It may be any real-world
                    object like a person, chair, table, pen, animal, car, etc.<br> A simple example of an object would
                    be a
                    car. Logically, you would expect a car to have

                    a model number or name. This would be considered the property of the car. You could

                    also expect a car to be able to do something, such as starting or moving. This would be

                    considered a method of the car.<br><br>

                    Code in object-oriented programming is organized around objects. Once you have your objects, they
                    can interact with each other to make something happen.

                    You need to have a class before you can create an object. When a class is defined, no memory is
                    allocated, but memory is allocated when it is instantiated (ie, an object is created).

                    <b>objectName:</b> It is the name of the object created by class name The class's default
                    constructor is called, and it dynamically allocates memory for one object of the class. The address
                    of the memory allocated is assigned to the pointer, objectName.

                    <p><b>Class: </b>

                        A class is a logical entity used to define a new data type. A class is a user-defined type that
                        describes what a particular kind of object will look like. A class contains variables(data
                        members), methods, and constructors.
                        <br><br>
                        Class is a blueprint or a set of instructions to build a specific type of object. It is a
                        fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming which revolves around real-life entities.
                        Class determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain
                        <br><br>
                        Data encapsulation is supported with "class". The class consists of both data and

                        functions. The data in a class is called a member, while functions in the class are called

                        methods.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>Data Members:-</b> The variables which are declared in any class by using any fundamental
                        data types
                        (like int, char, float, etc.) or derived data types (like class. structure, pointer, etc.) are
                        known as Data Members.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Methods:-</b> A method is the equivalent of a function in object-oriented
                        programming

                        that is used inside classes. The methods are the actions that perform operations. A

                        method accepts parameters as arguments, manipulates these, and then produces an

                        output when the method is called on an object.
                        <br><br>

                        <b> Constructor-</b> Constructors are special class functions that perform the initialization of
                        every
                        object. In C++, the constructor is automatically called when an object is created t is a special
                        method of the class because it does not have any retum type. It has the same name as the class
                        itself.

                    <p><b>Object: </b>
                        An object is an instance of a Class. It is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and
                        behavior. To access the members defined inside the class, we need to create the object of that
                        class. Objects are the basic units of object-oriented programming. It may be any real-world
                        object like a person, chair, table, pen, animal, car, etc.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Explaining object using Smartphone example with code:-</b> A simple example of an object
                        would be a
                        smartphone. Logically, you would expect a smartphone to have a model number or name. This would
                        be considered the property of the smartphone. You could also expect a smartphone to do
                        something, such as to send SMS, etc. This would be considered a method of the smartphone.
                        <br>

                        We have created a smartphone class earlier in the class module in the class module, and Now
                        wewill use that same class to make objects.
                        <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To create an object of a smartphone, specify the class name, followed by the object name.
                        </li><br>

                        <li> To access the class attributes or data members (like mode), use the dot syntax (.) on the
                            object followed by the attribute name.</li> <br>
                        <li>To call any method (print_details()) of class, use the dot syntax () on the object followed
                            by the method name.</li><br>

                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>You need to have a class before you can create an object. When a class is defined , no memory is
                        allocated , but memory is allocated when it is instatiated (i.e. an object is created).</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Access Specifier:- </b>
                        Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign access to the class members. It sets some
                        restrictions on the class members from accessing the outside functions directly. Access
                        specifiers have a vital role in securing data from unauthorized access.
                        <br>
                        It allows us to determine which class members are accessible to other classes and

                        functions and which are not. <br><br>There are three types of access modifiers available in C++:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public</li><br>

                        <li>Private</li><br>

                        <li>Protected</li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <b>Public:</b> All the class members with a public modifier can be accessed from anywhere(inside and
                    outside the class).
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Private:</b> All the class members with a private modifier can only be accessed by the member
                    function inside the class.<br><br>
                    <b>Protected:</b> The access level of a protected modifier is within the class and outside the class
                    through child class (or subclass). If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed outside
                    the class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>By Default:</b> All class members are private if you don't specify an access specifier.<br><br>

                    <p><b>Constructor- </b>
                        <br><br>

                        A constructor is a special member function automatically called when an object is created in
                        C++, the constructor is automatically called when an object is created. It is a special class
                        method because it does not have any return type. It has the same name as the class itself.
                        <br>
                        A constructor initializes the class data members with garbage value if we don't put any

                        value to it explicitly. The constructor must be placed in the public section of the class
                        because we want the class to be instantiated anywhere. For every object in its lifetime
                        constructor is called only once at the time of creation.<br>

                        <b>Example:</b>
                        <br><br>
                        class class name { <br><br>

                        int data member1;<br><br>

                        string data member2;<br><br>

                        //creating constructor<br><br>

                        public: <br><br> class_name() {<br><br>

                        // Initialize data members with garbage value<br><br>

                        Here, the function class name() is a constructor of the class 'class name. Notice that the

                        constructor<br><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li> has the same name as the class,</li><br>


                        <li> does not have any return type, and</li><br>

                        <li>it is public</li><br>

                        If we do not specify a constructor, the C++ compiler generates a default constructor for an
                        object (which expects no parameters and has an empty body).
                        </p>

                    <h5><b>Types of Constructors:</b></h5><br>

                    There are three types of constructors in C+ Default constructor<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parameterized Constructor</li>

                        <li>Copy Constructor</li>

                        <li>Default constructor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <h5><b>Default Constructor</b></h5><br>
                    A constructor that doesn't take any argument or has no parameters is known as a default constructor.
                    In the example above, class name() is a default constructor.<br>

                    <b>Syntax:</b>

                    class class name {<br><br>

                    int data members;<br><br>


                    string data member2;<br><br>

                    //default constructor<br><br>

                    public:<br><br>

                    class_name() {<br><br>

                    // Initializing data members with their default values<br><br>

                    data memberi 69;<br><br> data member2 "Cpp Champion";<br><br>
                    }<br><br>
                    };<br><br>

                    Here, the class named() constructor will be called when the object is created. This sets the data
                    member1 variable of the object to 69 and the data member2 variable of the object to "Cpp Champion"
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Note:</b> If we have not defined a constructor in our class, the C++ compiler will automatically
                    create
                    a default constructor with an empty code and no parameters, which will initialize data members with
                    garbage values<br><br>

                    When we write our constructor explicitly, the inbuilt constructor will not be available for us
                    <br>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <div>
                    <h5><b>Parameterized Constructor</b></h5><br>
                    This is another type of Constructor with parameters. The parameterized constructor takes its
                    arguments provided by the programmer. These arguments help initialize an object when it is created.
                    <br><br>
                    To create a parameterized constructor, simply add parameters to it the way you would to any other
                    function. When defining the constructor's body, use the parameters to initialize the object.
                    <br><br>
                    Using this Constructor, you can provide different values to data members of different objects by
                    passing the appropriate values as arguments.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Syntax:</b><br>

                    class class_name{ <br><br>

                    int data_member1;<br><br>

                    string data member2;<br><br>

                    //parameterized constructor<br><br>

                    public:<br><br>

                    class_name(int num, string str){ <br><br>

                    // initializing data members with values provided<br><br>



                    data member1 =num;<br><br> data_member2 =str;<br><br>
                    }<br><br>
                    };<br><br>

                    Here, we have created a parameterized constructor class name) that has 2 parameters: int num and
                    string str. The values contained in these parameters are used to initialize the member variables
                    data member1 and data member2.<br><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5><b>Copy Constructor:</b></h5><br>

                    These are a particular type of constructor that takes an object as an argument and copies values of
                    one object's data members into another object. We pass the class object into another object of the
                    same class in this constructor. As the name suggests, you Copy means to copy the values of one
                    Object into another Object of Class. This is used for Copying the values of a class object into
                    another object of a class, so we call them Copy constructor and for copying the values,
                    <br><br>

                    <h5><b>Constructor Overloading</b></h5>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    Constructor overloading can be defined as the concept of having more than one constructor with
                    different parameters so that every constructor can perform a different task.<br><br>

                    As there is a concept of function overloading, similarly constructor overloading is applied when we
                    overload a constructor more than a purpose.<br><br>

                    The declaration is the same as the class name, but there is no return type as they are

                    constructors.<br><br>

                    The criteria to overload a constructor is to differ the number of arguments or the type of
                    arguments. The corresponding constructor is called depending on the number and type of arguments
                    passed.<br><br>

                            Destructor
                        </b></h5>

                    <p>

                        A destructor is a special member function that works just opposite to a constructor; unlike
                        constructors that are used for initializing an object, destructors destroy (or delete) the
                        object. The purpose of the destructor is to free the resources that the object may have acquired
                        during its lifetime.<br><br>

                        ~class_name()<br><br>

                        //Some code<br><br>

                        Like the constructor, the destructor name should exactly match the class name. A destructor
                        declaration should always begin with the tilde(-) symbol, as shown in the syntax above.<br><br>

                        The thing is to be noted here, if the object is created by using new or the constructor

                        uses new to allocate memory that resides in the heap memory or the free store, the

                        destructor should use delete to free the memory.<br><br>

                        <b>When is a destructor called?</b><br><br>

                        A destructor function is called automatically when:<br><br>

                        → the object goes out of scope<br><br>

                        → the program ends<br><br>

                        → a scope (the () parenthesis) containing local variable ends.<br><br>

                        → a delete operator is called<br><br>

                        <b>Destructor rules</b><br>
                                            <ul type="*">

                        <li> There cannot be more than one destructor in a class.</li><br>

                        <li>Unlike constructors that can have parameters, destructors do not allow any

                        <li>They do not have any return type, not even void. I</li><br>

                        <li>A destructor should be declared in the public section of the class. The programmer cannot
                            access

                        An object is created by simply copying the data of all variables of the original object. Here,
                        the pointer will be copied but not the memory it points to it means that the original object and
                        the created copy will now point to the same memory address, which is generally not
                        preferred<br><br>

                        Since both objects will reference the exact memory location, then change made by one will
                        reflect those change in another object as well. This can lead to unpleasant side effects if the
                        elements of values are changed via some other reference. Since we wanted to create an object
                        replica, the Shallow copy will not fulfill this purpose
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Note:</b> C++ compiler implicitly creates a copy constructor and assignment operator to
