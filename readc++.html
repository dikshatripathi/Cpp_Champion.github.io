                    <b>History</b>
                </h3>
                <br>
                The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level &
                high-level language – a Middle-Level Language. The programming language was created, designed &
                developed by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known
                as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was
                similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance,
                default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched.
                <br>
                C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983. ++ is shorthand for adding
                one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C.”
                <br><br>
                The trace of the programming language C++ can be done back to 1979 when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing some
                development for this thesis for PhD. One in all the words Stroustrup had the chance to figure with, was
                a language referred to as Simula, that because the name implies, could be a language primarily designed
                for simulations. The Simula sixty-seven language – that was the variant that Stroustrup worked with is
                considered the primary language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found
                that this paradigm was helpful for package development; but, the Simula language was way too slow for
                practice & practical use.
                <br><br>
                Shortly subsequently, he began work on “C with Classes“, because what the name implies was meant to be a
                superset of the C language. His main dream was to get his advanced object-oriented programming, created
                by him, into the C language, which was during his era was still the programming language that was widely
                respected for its movability, portability & compactness, by not sacrificing the speed or the low-level
                practicality. His programming language enclosed inlining, basic inheritance, default function arguments,
                categories, and reliable sort was checking additionally to all or any the options of the C language.
                The first C with categories compiler was referred to as Cfront, that got derived from a C compiler
                referred to as CPre. It had been a program designed to translate C with categories code to universal C.
                A rather attention-grabbing purpose value noting is that Cfront was written mostly in C with classes,
                creating it a self-hosting compiler (a compiler which will compile itself). Cfront would later be
                abandoned in 1993 when it became troublesome to integrate new options into it, mainly C++ exceptions.
                Even so, Cfront created a significant impact on the implementations of future compilers and also the
                operating system UNIX.<br><br>
                In 1983, the name of the language got modified from C with categories to C++. The ++ operator within the
                C language is the associate operator for incrementing a variable, which provides some insight into
                however Stroustrup regarded the programming language. Several new options got additional around this
                point, the foremost notable of that area unit virtual functions, perform overloading, references with
                the const keyword, and single-line comments by using the two forward slashes (which may be a feature
                taken from the language BCPL).<br><br>
                In 1985, Stroustrup’s relation to the language entitled The C++ programming language was printed and got
                released. That very same year, C++ got enforced as an advertisement product and hence starting of it as
                a commercial element. The programming language wasn’t formally standardized, nevertheless creating the
                book an essential reference. The programming language was updated once more in 1989 to incorporate
                protected and static members, still as an associate inheritance from many categories & classes.
                In 1990, The Annotated C++ manual, which was a reference got released all over. In 1990 only, in the
                same & identical year, Borland’s Turbo C++ compiler would also be commercially discharged as an
                advertisement product. Turbo C++ additional an excessiveness of other libraries which might have a
                substantial impact on C++’s development. Though Turbo C++’s last stable unharness was in 2006, the
                compiler continues to get widely used.<br><br>
                In 1998, the C++ customary advisory & standards committee printed the first international standard for
                C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which might be informally called C++98. The Annotated C++ manual was
                aforementioned to be a significant influence within the development of the quality. The quality template
                library (also known as the Standard Template Library) that began its intellectual construction in 1979
                got additionally enclosed in it. In 2003, the committee well-versed multiple issues that were according
                with their 1998 customary and revised it consequently. The modified language got dubbed as C++03.
                In 2005, the same committee of C++ discharged a technical report (called as TR1) particularization
                varied options they were aiming to boost the newest C++ standard. The new rule was informally dubbed
                C++0x because it was expected to be discharged someday before the tip of the first decade. Ironically,
                however, the new customary wasn’t fulfilled until mid-2011. Many technical reports were discharged up
                till then, and a few compilers began adding experimental support for the new options and features.
                In mid-2011, the new C++ customary (dubbed C++11) got finished. The Boost library project created a
                substantial impact on the new rule, and a few of the new modules were derived directly from the
                corresponding Boost libraries. A number of the new options that got included were:<br>
                New for loop syntax providing practicality just like foreach loops in specific different languages
                Customary threading library (which up till 2011 each C and C++ were lacking)<br>
                <ul>
               <li>Variadic templates</li>
               <li>Automotive vehicle (AUTO) keyword</li>
               <li>New instrumentation categories & classes</li>
               <li>New C++ time library, atomics support</li>
               <li>Comprehensive organization library</li>
               <li>Regular expression support</li>
               <li>Higher support for unions and array-initialization lists</li>
            </ul>
                C++20 is the latest version of C++. A newer & advanced version of C++ is being released, i.e. C++23.
                C++ is still the third most popular programming language according to the TIOBE Index’s latest study of
                2019, behind Java & C, by knocking out Python. All credits for this go to the newly released C++11
                version, which according to the users made it much robust, safer, easier simpler, and more expressive.
                Bjarne Stroustrup has created excellent work with C++. C could be a low-level programming language, and
                so, it does not have any classes. It does not contain several options which will create programming more
                well-off, however, is that the quickest language (assembly is more rapid; however, programming in
                construction isn’t one thing you’d consider), what Bjarne Stroustrup did he additional the thing
                orientated half, by treating code like life objects. What makes C++ therefore lovely is that it’s the
                speed of C and it’s additionally a high-level programming language, therefore allow us to say the most
                effective of each world. However on the opposite hand, C++ is challenging to be noted to newbies, and
                for an equivalent code that you wrote on C++, you’ll be able to write in Python for the quarter of the
                time.

            <h3><b>About C++</b></h3><br>
            As we Know , C++ is a general-purpose programming language. This language is around 40 years old and has
            been a
            part of many
            software problems and projects. C++ language is preferred to make high-performance software and is among
            the top
            programming languages.
            <br><br>
            C++ is considered as a <b>foundation language</b> for many languages. It is one of the essential
            languages that
            you
            must know if you are interested in computer science. There is a very high chance that every other
            programmer or
            software developer who is doing great in his life is familiar with the concepts and fundamentals of C++.
            There
            are many different kinds of jobs out there that require C++ language. It is a versatile language, so it
            remains
            in high demand amongst professionals, such as software developers, game developers, C++ analysts and
            backend
            developers, etc.
            <br>
            As per the TIOBE index of 2022, C++ lies at 4th position in the world’s most popular language. The
            career or job
            opportunities for C++ programmers are enormous because C++ is an old language, and a lot of code is
            already
            written in this language.

                        <li>C++ is an Efficient and Fast Language
                    </b></h5>

                <p>C++ is an advanced language that supports various programming methods like functional, procedural,
                    and
                    object-oriented programming. It is a fast language; its compile-time and execution time is faster
                    than other
                    programming languages. Some programming languages are also faster than C++. Still, like C++, they
                    are not
                    close to the machine code, as it is an intermediary language, so big organizations rely on C++ for
                    fast speed
                    with lesser resources.</p>

                        <li>Suitable for Big Projects
                    </b></h5>
                <p>C++ programming language is very well suited for big projects. Many projects, including compilers,
                    cloud
                    storage systems, databases, game development, graphic designs, etc., are built using C++. C++ is
                    also used for
                    making 3D visuals projects, these projects require control over huge amounts of data efficiently,
                    and C++ is
                    one of the best choices for that.
                    <br>
                    Also, many applications and software that you use or go through in your daily lives are developed in
                    C++. For
                    example, Spotify, the popular music streaming application, has its backend code is written in C++.
                    You all
                    know Youtube, C++ is used in building YouTube video processing function. The Amazon application was
                    also
                    written in C++, however, there are changes over the years and more software like these are developed
                    using
                    C++.

                    </b></h5>
                <p>C++ is an old language and is being studied and learned by most of the programmers around the globe,
                    so it
                    has huge community support. The large community of C++ means it will be easier and more flexible to
                    learn this
                    language. Community plays a very important role for a learner. If someone needs any help or guidance
                    regarding
                    C++, many programmers and experts are out there on different platforms creating resources for C++.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the resources are blogs, for example, C++ Tips of the week https://abseil.io/tips/, Podcasts
                    like
                    CppCast CppCast, and organizations like The C++ Alliance, and many more are out there that can guide
                    you
                    through your problem. These resources can help a learner or programmer understand this language and
                    clear the

                        <li>Helps You in Earning Other Programming Languages
                    </b></h5>
                <p>C++ is an intermediate-level language; learning this language will give you a much deeper
                    understanding of
                    programming structure. In C++, you have to write, declare, and explain everything in the source
                    code, giving
                    you a deeper knowledge of all the program parts.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, the syntax of C, C++, and Java are almost the same, so learning Java and C after C++ will be
                    very easy.
                    <br><br>
                    Other languages like Python are much easier to understand because they are almost syntax-free. You
                    don't have
                    to specify everything while writing its code, which makes the programming part easy, but you don't
                    get the
                    opportunity to learn the logic structure of the program like C++. Once you have learned the C++
                    language, then
                    other languages will be easy for you to learn, as your foundation becomes strong.

                        <li>Embedded Systems
                    </b></h5>
                <p>An embedded system is a microprocessor-based software and hardware system that is used to design a
                    specific
                    function. Developing these embedded systems requires fast and efficient languages like C++. C++ is
                    widely used
                    in embedded systems because it is an intermediary language. It has both the features of the
                    high-level and
                    low-level language, which gives C++ an edge over other languages because it can directly access the
                    hardware
                    part without sacrificing the high-level part.
                    <br><br>
                    Many embedded systems and gadgets like smartwatches, GPS systems, mp3 players, etc., are created
                    using C++.

                <p>C++ is around 40 years old language and is still one of the most popular languages; why is it so? C++
                    is
                    versatile in nature and is a highly adaptable language. Due to high adaptability, it is still useful
                    when it
                    comes to software and developing games. It is widely used for so long that it is compatible with
                    many
                    languages and is in demand in many sectors. Also, top-tier companies seek employees with a good
                    understanding
                    of C++ programming.</p>

                    </b></h5>
                <p>Apart from Python, C++ is also used for simulations. Many simulations are created with the help of
                    the C++
                    library, which is considered an alternative to the Python language. The object-oriented approach
                    provides
                    faster execution, full accessibility to the base language, portable models and executables, and
                    complementary
                    development tools. The simulation built with tools has the benefits of an object-oriented design,
                    including
                    encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and parameterized typing. </p>

                <p>There are many modern-day databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, MemSQL, etc. that are written in C++.
                    This is because C++ is quite modern and it supports features like exceptions, lambda expressions,
                    etc. Many of the databases that are written in C++ are used in almost all of the in-use applications

                    are written in Java along with C/C++ with non-default run-times for C++ support. Also, C++ can be
                    used to develop the core of the applications in iOS. In general, C or C++ are used in operating
                    systems because of the speed and strongly typed nature of these languages. </p>

                <hr>
                
                <ol type="I">
                    <li><b>Existence of Libraries: </b>The C++ programming language offers a library full of in-built
                        functions that make things easy for the programmer. These functions can be accessed by including
                        suitable header files.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Speed: </b>C++ is compiler-based hence it is much faster than other programming languages
                        like
                        Python and Java that are interpreter-based.</li><br>
                    <li><b>DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation): </b>Since C++ supports the use of pointers, it allows us to
                        allocate memory dynamically. We may even use constructors and destructors while working with
                        classes and objects in C++.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Case sensitive: </b>Just like C, it is pretty clear that the C++ programming language treats
                        the uppercase and lowercase characters in a different manner. For instance, the meaning of the
                        keyword ‘cout’ changes if we write it as ‘Cout’ or “COUT”. Other programming languages like HTML
                        and MySQL are not case sensitive.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Popular:</b>After learning C, it is the base language for many other popular programming
                        languages which supports the feature of object-oriented programming. Bjarne Stroustrup found
                        Simula 67, the first object-oriented language ever, lacking simulations and decided to develop
                        C++.</li><br>
                    <li><b>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): </b>This is one of the most important features of C++. It
                        employs the use of objects while programming. These objects help you implement real-time
                        problems based on data abstraction, data encapsulation, data hiding, and polymorphism.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Data abstraction:</b> Data abstraction is an act of representing the important
                                features of data
                                without including the background details or the method applied to obtain it.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Data encapsulation:</b> Data encapsulation is nothing but a process to implement data
                                abstraction by wrapping up the data and functions into an exclusive block.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Inheritance:</b> The term inheritance refers to transferring the properties of the
                                parent class
                                to the child class. We can implement the basic idea of inheritance by creating more than
                                one
                                class, which we formally refer to as derived classes by linking them with what we call
                                the
                                base class. This concept reduces the redundancy of the program and makes it easy to
                                transfer/copy the properties of one class to another</li><br>
                            <li><b> Data hiding:</b> Data hiding refers to protecting data from unauthorized access. It
                                is basically
                                responsible for securing the data. It is important to note that data encapsulation is
                                different from data hiding as encapsulation mainly focuses on shifting the focus on
                                important data than explaining its complex nature.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Polymorphism:</b> The word poly means ‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’. Clearly,
                                polymorphism
                                refers to displaying that data in more than one form.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
